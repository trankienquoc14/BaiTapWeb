            Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <b>Leonhard Euler</b> 
            was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant<br> 
            of mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of 
            physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler<br>
            was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 
            different books and papers. His influence was felt in physics and<br> astronomy 
            as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, <i>Introductio in analysin 
            infinitorum</i> (1748) remained a standard textbook for well<br> over a century. For 
            the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote <i>Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne</i> 
            (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical<br> outline of the main physical theories of the time.

            One can hardly do math without copying Euler. 
            Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's 
            writings. He is perhaps<br> best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula
            <br>
            <br>
            cos(x) + isin(x) = e<sup>(ix)</sup>
            <br>
            <br>
            demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation
            <br>
            <br>
            e<sup>(&Pi;i)</sup> + 1 = 0
            <br>
            <br>
            which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &Pi;, e, and i in a single beautiful and elegant statement.
            <br>
            <br>
            Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.
